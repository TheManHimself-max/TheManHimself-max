### 👨‍💻 About Me

<p>
I’m currently enrolled in the <strong>ALX Software Development Program</strong>, diving deep into Front-end web development while applying my background in operations to solve real-world problems. I transitioned into tech because <strong>, working in an Agri-tech company, I wanted to participate in the development and deployment of innovative platforms that seek to better the daily operations of smallholder farmers </strong>. I’m passionate about <strong> learning how the different languages, JavaScript, CSS and HTML all interact together to bring code to life.</strong>.  
</p>

<p>
My inspiration comes from <strong>seeing the challenges communities face every day such as limited access to education, inefficient systems, and untapped potential. Working at DigiFarm showed me how tech can bridge these gaps. I’m inspired by the power of simple, scalable tools to transform lives—and I want to be part of that change.</strong>. I believe that technology is a tool for empowerment, and I’m committed to building scalable solutions that uplift communities and improve operations across industries.
